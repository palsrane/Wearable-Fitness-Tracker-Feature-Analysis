* Results summary:  
* ------------------  
@ Activity was reported by 100% of this sample population and it was the most reported feature by individuals. Analysis of day-by-day feature-use showed   
that the number daily Activity logs by the users increased significantly in the second month.
@ Sleep was the next most popular feature, followed by heart rate.  
The number of people using the sleep and heart rate did not change from first to the second month. However, number of daily reports of heart rate more  
than doubled in the second month. Detailed inspection of the heat maps indicated that this increase resulted from increase in reporting frequency in  
the people who had reported heart rate in the first month.  
@ All the reports of weight, hence possibly fat, were manually entered.  
@ The number of users reporting metrics that needed to be entered manually like the number of people reporting logged activities distances, weight, and   
fat, appeared less popular and were reported by very few people, and though reports of weight increased in the second month, that was only because of   
increase in report rate by one user.  
  
* Insights and Recommendations:  
* ------------------------------  
  
** Changing heart rate collection frequency:  
  
It was interesting that heart rate was reported by less than 50% of the population. Activity rtacker watches have built-in heart rate monitors. However,   
it is possible that users are not using this feature in order to prolong the battery life on their devices.  
During the analysis it was noted that the heart rate is being collected every 5 seconds, and hence beats-per minute are being computed on a rolling basis.   
Changing the collection time to every 10 seconds or to even every 20 seconds would halve or quarter the energy consumption of this feature and would not   
significantly affect the reports being generated.   
Heart rate collection rate can also be varied depending upon the activity by giving the user the ability to report start and end of an activity. That way   
the heart rate collection rate can be increased to the per 5 seconds during those times, and then dropped back down to every 10 or 20 seconds for normal   
day to day activities.  
A longer battery life would also be a great marketing point, and this would only need update to the software.  
  
** Adding automatic sleep detection:  
  
Sleep records are missing in more than 25% of the population, and even when a user reported sleep, the frequency is quite low. This implies that the   
user is possibly having to manually start sleep recording.  
Respiration is known to slow down during sleep. Respiration shows up as low frequency variations in heart rate recordings. Since, the smart watches use  
technology similar to pulse oximeter, it might be possible to isolate low frequency variations from the heart rate recordings, and any slowing in the  
respiratory frequency along with lower activity levels could be reported as sleep.  
This automatic detection could be in addition to the manual start of sleep, and would be a really appealing feature to the future buyers of the device.  
  
** Encourage users to log activities:  
  
Activity is being logged automatically as very active minutes. However, prompting a user to log an activity after the end of a very active session might  
increase the logging frequency of activities and help us provide the user with better health recommendations.  
		
** Weight and fat scale that can integrate with the smart activity device:  
  
Development of a weight scale that can measure fat that can integrate with the smart watch and associated app using a Bluetooth connectivity, and provide 
insights on effect of users activity on their weight can shed light on possible need for diet alteration and point users towards bellabeats integrated 
consultation services.
